For realzies this time.

Seeing as I had to redo the start, I will add two TEMPORARY new poems...
One about the peculiar nature of truth, as any philosopher/mathematician 
must understand to some extent...

-----------------------------------
THOUGH love repine and reason chafe 
There came a voice without reply 
'T is man's perdition to be safe, 
When for the truth he ought to die.
-----------------------------------

Short but apt...
Secondly a more humorous poem.


"Happy Vegetarian" ~ By G.K. Chesterton:

You will find me drinking rum,
Like a sailor in a slum,
You will find me drinking beer like a Bavarian
You will find me drinking gin
In the lowest kind of inn
Because I am a rigid Vegetarian.

So I cleared the inn of wine,
And I tried to climb the sign,
And I tried to hail the constable as “Marion.”
But he said I couldn’t speak,
And he bowled me to the Beak
Because I was a Happy Vegetarian.

Oh, I know a Doctor Gluck,
And his nose it had a hook,
And his attitudes were anything but Aryan;
So I gave him all the pork
That I had, upon a fork
Because I am myself a Vegetarian.

I am silent in the Club,
I am silent in the pub.,
I am silent on a bally peak in Darien;
For I stuff away for life
Shoving peas in with a knife,
Because I am a rigid Vegetarian.

No more the milk of cows
Shall pollute my private house
Than the milk of the wild mares of the Barbarian
I will stick to port and sherry,
For they are so very, very,
So very, very, very, Vegetarian.
